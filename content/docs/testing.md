### Why Test?

If you don't want to write code, you can test EVEmu! Just follow directions on [Getting Started](/docs/getting_started )to either build from source or get the nightly builds for your machine, modify the client, fire it up and start trying things.

Experience with EVE live is very helpful since it will provide you with a reference for how in-game features are supposed to work.

### What to test

Check out our current [project status](/project_status) test components which are currently stated for requiring testing.
