# Welcome to the new EVEmu project site.

Hi there, the EVEmu project has been going on for over 15 years now and we have finally decided to create a new website for the project.

This site is currently a work in progress and we will be working on bringing over content from the old Wiki including documentation, and more.

## Next Steps

As we reorganize our documentation and add more content here, we are looking towards the following being goals:

*   Migrate content from old Wikia to new website
*   Setup CI for automated builds and testing
*   Release 0.7.9 of the EVEmu server
*   Update documentation for to reduce barrier to contribution
