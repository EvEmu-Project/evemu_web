# About Us
The EVEmu project has been around for 15 years by a dedicated team of EVE Online fans and C++ developers.

# Disclaimer
EVEmu is an educational project. This means, our primary interest is to learn and teach us and our users more about C++ project development in a large scale. Our software is not intended for running public servers, and we do not support that. We are not responsible for what others do with the source code downloaded from this project.

We do not provide access to the client software.
